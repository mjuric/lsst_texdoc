\frame {\frametitle{ DM architecture \& products}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Would like to get  a list of products in DM
	\item Related to understanding the DM architecture - KT working on LDM-148 update more from him in a while
	\item Those are not Data Products - mostly Systems and Software artefacts
	\item For each product identify {\em Product Owner} and manager.
	\item This would change the org chart ..
	
	\end{itemize}

\frame {\frametitle{ Risk Management and other processes ..}
Also in LDM-294:
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Would like an open Risk approach - anyone can raise a risk (Tim working on that)	
	 \item Document management - in next slid as
	 \item Configuration control 
	 \item Product assurance  and Scientific Validation 
	\item \ldots
	\end{itemize}
Mainly these will be high level and point to the details in other documents.
