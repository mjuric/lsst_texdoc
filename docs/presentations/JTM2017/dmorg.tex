\frame {\frametitle{ DM architecture \& products}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Would like to get  a list of products in DM
	\item related to understanding the DM architecture - KT working on LDM-148 update more from him in a while
	\item Those are not Data Products - mostly Systems and Software artefacts
	\item For each product identify {\em Product Owner} and manager.
	\item This would change the org chart ..
	\end{itemize}
