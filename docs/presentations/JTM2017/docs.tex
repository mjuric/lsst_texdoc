\begin{itemize}
  \item  We will be working on a Documentation Tree for DM
   \item Some documents exist - some have not yet been found
   \item Wish to figure out what is missing 
   \item LDM-294 will have a section on documentation
  \item  adhere to LSST Document Plan LPM-051\citell{LPM-051} 
   \item would like a bibtex file of all Docushare issued documents 

\item {\color{red} All products should be listed and for each product the set of docs expected and the dates}  
        \begin{itemize}
	\item each document type is  targeted at a different audience (e.g. Requirement, Design/Implementation, Installation, User \ldots 
	\item not all products have all document types). 
        \end{itemize}
