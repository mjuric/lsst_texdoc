\begin{itemize}
\item Encouraging experiences from AGIS 
\item Team feedback suggests leadership important
\item XP is more process oriented than "normal" development
\item So  managed to pass  ESA reviews for the entire DPAC system 
\item We have tried to pick “useful” documents from ECSS
\item We do need documentation it is nice to have a set of templates for these
\item Still pressure for traditional planning and accounting - care to be taken on this one 
\item For sanity one should read Dilbert every day …

\end{itemize}
