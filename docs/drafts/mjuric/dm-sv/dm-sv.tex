\setDocAbstract { 

In this document we lay out the scope and organizational concepts of the LSST {\bf Data Management Science Verification} (DM SV) effort. 
% The primary objective of this document is to define a high-level mechanism by
% which we will validate that the delivered DM system, as a whole, is on track
% to being capable to acceptably support the science goals of commissioning and
%operations -- {\bf DM Science Verification}. 
We define Science Verification as {\em
the assurance that the Data Management system meets the needs of the
scientific community and other identified stakeholders}.  \\

This documents defines the scope of the SV work, the deliverables, the
breakdown of work, as well as assigns responsibilities for DM-specific SV
within the DM Organization.
