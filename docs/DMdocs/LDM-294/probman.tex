\section{Data Management Problem Management/Escalation}
The above organizational structure allocates significant responsibility to lead institutions.  As such, when problems arise that cannot be solved with the responsibility and scope allocated to an institution, the path of escalation and resolution of such problems must be clear.  In cases of problems that cannot be solved within the DM organization, that escalation path must also be clear.  \figref{fig:probman}  depicts the escalation path for such problem resolution.
