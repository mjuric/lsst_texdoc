\section{Introduction \label{sect:intro}}

Risk management has become a standard element in project management. In simplest terms, all "risk management" means is anticipating problems and taking actions to avoid these problems: good practice for any complex endeavour. Formalising a risk management plan insures that risk management becomes a standard and regularised task in running a project.

\subsection{Scope \label{sect:scope}}

This document defines the risk management process for the Data Management (DM) part of the LSST project.

\section{Project Summary \label{sect:project}}

%-Objectives of LSS. reference to Project overview .\\
The goal of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project is to conduct a 10-year survey of the sky that will deliver a 200 petabyte set of images and data products that will build a large-aperture, wide-field, optical imaging facility designed to address some of the most pressing questions about the structure and evolution of the universe and the objects in it.  For more details see \citellp{Document-15077}

The DM (Data Management) subsystem represents the science ground segment of the LSST, responsible for the data processing of the data stream. Its objective is the production of a set of science pipelines to produce the LSST Science Products \citellp{LSE-163}. 

For further details of the responsibilities within DM see the Management Plan\footnote{Update due April 2017} \citellp{LDM-294}.

\section{Risk management principles \label{sect:principles}}

Risk management process in DM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Derives naturally from \citell{LPM-20} just extending the process to all parts of DM.
\item Should initially be simple and straight-forward: The risk management plan can evolve as needed.
\item Should be independent of any tool adopted to assist in risk management.
\item Should be a supporting activity to the project and not a burden: Administrative overhead should therefore be kept to a minimum.
\item Should periodically reassess risks, to take into account experience, evolution of the project, changing context of project, etc.
\item Should take place at the DM level first with major risks promoted to LSST level.
\end{itemize}
