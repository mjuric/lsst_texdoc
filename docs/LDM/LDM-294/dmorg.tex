\section{Data Management Organization Structure}
This section defines the organization structure for the period in which the DM System is developed and commissioned, up to the start of LSST Observatory operations.  
(\appref{sect:precon} gives historical  Pre-Construction Phase Organization).

The DM Project Manager and DM Project Scientist, who are known collectively as DM Management, lead the DM Subsystem.  The Project Manager has direct responsibility for coordination with the overall LSST Project Office, the LSST Change Control Board, the LSST Corporation, and LSST partner organizations on all budgetary, schedule, and resource matters.  The Project Scientist has primary scientific and technical responsibility in the DM and responsibility for ensuring that the scientific requirements of the LSST are supported, and is a member on the LSST Project Science Team (PST). 

As shown in \figref{fig:dmorg}, the organization now features lead institutions, each with responsibility for major element of the DM System (Level 2 Work Breakdown Structure elements).  For example, during Final Design, the Process Control and Archive Site Manager and Team at NCSA will be conducting prototyping activities in computing, data communications, and data storage to select and verify the ability of System technologies to support the LSST requirements.  They will also be involved in creating a supporting infrastructure for the DM Systems.  During Construction before the LSST first light time frame, these resources will be focused on implementation of the selected technologies.  In order to ensure that team functions as one integrated project, the institutions coordinate support by other lead institution team members directly through this organizational structure, as well as via a number of cross-organizational bodies (described later in this document). 
Also, due to the span of the organization, the DM Project Manager may be supported by one of the lead institution Project Managers as a Deputy Project Manager in these phases.
